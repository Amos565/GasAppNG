## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in the project, please follow the guidelines below:

Reporting Process: Send an email to our security team at security@gasapp.com. Please include detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and any relevant proof-of-concept code or screenshots.

Response Time: We strive to acknowledge vulnerability reports within 48 hours and will provide an initial assessment of the report. Please note that the actual resolution time may vary depending on the complexity of the vulnerability.

Vulnerability Assessment: Our security team will thoroughly assess the reported vulnerability to determine its validity and potential impact. During this process, we may request additional information or clarification from the reporter if needed.

Notification and Fixes: If the vulnerability is accepted and confirmed, we will develop and release a fix based on the severity and complexity of the issue. Once the fix is ready, we will notify the reporter and affected users, providing instructions on how to apply the necessary updates or patches.

Security Updates: Security updates will be released for the supported versions mentioned in the "Supported Versions" section above. It is highly recommended that users upgrade to the latest supported version to ensure they receive security patches and fixes.

Disclosure and Credit: We value responsible disclosure. After the vulnerability has been resolved, we encourage reporters to work with us to schedule an appropriate time for public disclosure. We also acknowledge the efforts of security researchers who responsibly report vulnerabilities and are open to giving credit to them if they wish.

Please note that vulnerabilities in unsupported versions (versions earlier than 4.0.x) will not be eligible for security updates. Therefore, it is crucial to keep your project up to date with the latest supported version.

We appreciate the security community's efforts in helping us maintain the integrity and security of our project. If you have any further questions or need clarifications, please don't hesitate to contact our security team at security@example.com.
